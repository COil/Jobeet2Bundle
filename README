Jobeet2
=======

Current Symfony2 version: 2.0.8

This is full Jobeet2 tutorial for Symfony2. All the code was done by me and I didn't
cheat on others implementations so the code may vary with what you'll find on other
Jobeet2 repositories.

Nevertheless, I tried to produce the cleanest code I could by respecting 100%
of the Symfony2 coding standarts.

1) Installation
---------------

Download the Symfony2 standart edition.
Follow the instructions mentionned in the README.md file and remove the demo Acme
bundle.

### Testing configuration

$ php app/check.php

Correct your configuration depending on the results. 
(Note that your PHP cli configuration could be different from your Apache one)

2) Bundle initialization
------------------------

$ php app/console generate:bundle

* Namespace: "COil/Jobeet2Bundle"
* Bundle name: "Jobeet2Bundle"
* Target directory: leave the default value
* Format to use: leave the default value
* Generate the whole directory structure: "yes"
* Confirm: "yes"

3) Layout
---------

* Copy a default layout in "COil\Jobeet2Bundle\Resourses\Views\layout.html.twig"
