Jobeet2
=======

Current Symfony2 version: 2.0.7

This is full Jobeet2 tutorial for Symfony2. All the code was done by me and I didn't
cheat on others implementations so the code may vary with what you'll find on other
Jobeet2 repositories.

Nevertheless, I tried to produce the cleanest code I could with respecting 100%
of the Symfony2 coding standarts.

1) Installation
---------------

Follow the instructions mentionned in the README.md file of the Symfony2 standart
edition.

### Testing configuration

$ php app/check.php

Correct your configuration depending on the results. 
(Note that your PHP cli configuration could be different from your Apache one)

2) Bundle initialization
------------------------

$ php app/console generate:bundle

* Namespace: "Jobeet/JobeetBundle"
* Bundle name: "JobeetBundle"
* Target directory: leave the default value
* Format to use: leave the default value
* Generate the whole directory structure: "yes"
* Confirm: "yes"
