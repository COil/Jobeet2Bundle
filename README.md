Jobeet2
=======

This Jobeet2 tutorial actually works wiyh Symfony2 standard edition: *2.0.9*

All the code was done by me and I didn't cheat on other implementations so the code
may vary with what you will find on other Jobeet2 repositories.

Nevertheless, I tried to produce the cleanest code I could by respecting 100%
of the Symfony2 coding standarts. The code will be cleaned and improved as
I will gain experience with Symfony2.

No tutorial here, just code ! :)

Additional bundles used:

* doctrine-fixtures
* DoctrineFixturesBundle
